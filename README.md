# Mock-Research-Web-Portal
A mock web portal created as a group final project for a class at WSU: CptS 322 Software Engineering Principles I.

This project does a great job showcasing a lot of things. The most important is that it shows my ability to work on a team. I worked with two other classmates on this project, evenly distributing the work amongst ourselves. We maintained a clean work tree throughout the duration of the project and followed an Agile Scrum framework, working in two week milestones with review meetings for each. This project is also a great example of my ability to work on both the frontend and backend. Because we divided the work evenly, we all worked on each part of the application, giving me plenty of time working on both the UI and database functionality, and the communications between the two. It shows that I have a solid understanding of the importance to maintain low coupling and high cohesion. We separated the code into a Model-View-Contoller model to ensure that our coupling and cohesion were at satisfiable levels. This application takes advantage of existing libraries like MySQL and Flask, reinforcing my abilities at being resourceful and making the most of what already exists to ensure that the final product is effecient and refined.

## Getting started

1. Create a virtual env (optional)
   * Run `python3 -m venv venv`
   * This will create a virtual environment called venv
   * You can activate the virtual env with `. venv/bin/activate` on Linux or `venv/scripts/activate.bat` on Windows
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application with `flask run`
